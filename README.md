# StatsBook

Learning in college, especially statistics, was never an easy task. Theres only so much time a professor can dedicate inside and outside the classroom to support students throughout the learning process. As college students, we often rely on material we find online such as videos, study groups, among others to help mitigate that. However, the process itself can still be overwhelming. It's the reason I decided to pursue this project to build a book in R that helps students learn statistics.
